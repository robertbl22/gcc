		Georgia&rsquo;s &ldquo;Port Tax Bonus&rdquo; is available for industries that locate or expand, in Georgia and utilize Georgia&rsquo;s ports. This incentive offers additional job tax credits to businesses for each of 4 tiers of counties that add the required threshold of jobs and increase their port traffic through Georgia&rsquo;s port facilities by 10% in one year from the base level.
	</p>
	<p>
		Base level of traffic is set at 75 tons, 10 TEUs or five containers. The total tax credit amount cannot exceed 50% of the taxpayer&rsquo;s state income liability for a single year. These credits can be carried forward 10 years if jobs and port traffic remain in service and above the base-level increases.
