HOW TO UPDATE THE CORRIDOR PICKER MAP


1.) There should be an Illustrator file that has the vector art in layers. Make changes there. Corridors shapes MUST be one path, not grouped, not a Compound path. (NOTE: Can you add alt tag and href links in Illustrator?)

2.) Open the Illustrator file into Fireworks.

3.) Trim the canvas to fit.

4.) Resize the image to 390px wide.

5.) On each corridor shape, right-click and choose "Insert as Hotspot". (NOTE: Can you add alt tag and href links in Fireworks?)

6.) Export as HTML with images.

7.) Copy generated 'map' element into corridorPicker.html. Rename the map element ID to match the "usemap" attribute. Update the GIF in images directory. NOTE: If no changes are needed to the rollover hot spots, then just update the GIF image. Add the appropriate href link and alt tag for each corridor.
