DEPLOY NOTES!

**************************
Gaports.com main.css
We link to the style sheet used for all of Gaports.com. But IE8 needs respond.js, and respond.js needs css files to be local. For deploy, remove local reference to main.css and point it to the copy in Portals.
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/Portals/2/Skins/2013/styles/main.css">

For more info, see "Browser and device support" at:

************************
Dynamic image resizing
http://bbimagehandler.codeplex.com/

TURN SECURITY ON FOR PRODUCTION! For development, it needs to be turned off. Modify web.config to turn it back on.

We resize and cache property images. This is especially important for the site aerial photos because they are large. This is used in the directives "property-thumbnail" and "property-photo".

Example path:
http://www.gaports.com/bbimagehandler.ashx?Url=somewhere.com/image.jpg&width=150

There is a key in web.config with settings:
<add key="BBImageHandler" value="EnableClientCache=true;EnableServerCache=true;EnableSecurity=true;EnableSecurityExceptions=true;ImageCompression=90&AllowedDomains=bitboxx.com" />
